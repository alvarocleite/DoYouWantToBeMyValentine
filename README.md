# 💘 Do You Want To Be My Valentine? (The "Yes" Extortion Service)

Are you afraid of rejection? Do you have a crush but lack the self-esteem to handle a "No"?

**Welcome to the future of romance.**

This is a scientifically engineered, highly advanced, commitment-forcing web application. It guarantees a **100% success rate** for your Valentine proposals. How? By simply removing free will from the equation.

## 🚀 How It Works

1.  **The Illusion of Choice:** We present the target with two buttons: "Yes" and "No".
2.  **The "No" Button has Anxiety:** If they try to click "No", the button will literally run away. It detects the mouse cursor (or touch) and teleports to safety. It's faster than Usain Bolt fleeing a commitment ceremony.
3.  **The Only Option:** Eventually, out of frustration or amusement, they *will* click "Yes".
4.  **Celebration:** Confetti! GIFs! Happiness! You are now dating. (Legally binding status: *Questionable*).

## 💌 Personalize The Trap

You can customize the question to address your specific victim—er, *Valentine*. Just add a `?name=` parameter to the URL.

**Usage:**
```

```

**Examples:**
*   **For Sarah:** `https://alvarocleite.github.io/DoYouWantToBeMyValentine/?name=Sarah`
*   **For your cat:** `https://alvarocleite.github.io/DoYouWantToBeMyValentine/?name=Mr.%20Whiskers`
